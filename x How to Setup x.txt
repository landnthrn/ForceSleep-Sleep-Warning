BETTER PC SLEEP + SLEEP WARNING
This feature simulates the regular sleeping system and adds more convenience to it.
Comes with a mini UI in command prompt.

MAIN USES:
Ease of access & speed with changing specifics to your sleeping setup, useful for certain tasks

Got a task that requires your PC to stay awake for long periods of time? Set a sleep timer, or disable sleep in seconds with the cmd UI

Want you're PC to sleep after a download/upload is expected to finish? Set a sleep timer for it

You're PC refuses to sleep and you just can't figure out the cause of it? This will simulate the default sleeping system for you

CMD Sleep Commands:  
sleep             — Display this list of commands  
sleepon          — Enable idle sleep  
sleepoff         — Disable idle sleep (perfect for long downloads & so on)  
sleepstatus      — Check if the watcher is enabled/disabled  
sleeptime        — Change the set idle time to trigger sleep
sleeprestart     — Restart the sleep watcher task manually

You can cancel sleep by pressing `Ctrl + C` while the warning is visible, 
or pause/resume the countdown by clicking the window and pressing any key. 

If you have media/audio playing, it will pause all audio before sleep triggers

HOW TO SETUP SLEEP WATCHER / SLEEP WARNING:  

— Go to your Documents folder

— Create a folder called `Scripts`

— Create another folder inside `Scripts` called `ForceSleep`

— Place all the files from this download into there

— Search Windows for "Environment Variables"

— Once the System Properties tab opens, select Environment Variables again.

— Under User Variables (top list), select `Path`, then click `Edit`

— Click `New` and paste the path to your sleep watcher folder
  `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Scripts\ForceSleep`

— (Optional but foolproof) Add the Scripts folder path too: 
  `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Scripts`

— Replace `%USERNAME%` with your PC user name

— Click OK a few times to close Environment Variables

— Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command:

$taskName    = "ForceSleep_Watcher"
$scriptPath  = "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Scripts\ForceSleep\forcesleep.ps1"
$powershellExe = Join-Path $env:WINDIR "System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"

try {
    Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName $taskName -Confirm:$false -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    # Task doesn't exist yet – that's fine
}

$action    = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute $powershellExe `
    -Argument "-NoProfile -NoLogo -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File `"$scriptPath`""
$trigger   = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId $env:USERNAME -LogonType Interactive -RunLevel Limited

$settings  = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -ExecutionTimeLimit (New-TimeSpan -Days 3)
$settings.DisallowStartIfOnBatteries = $false
$settings.StopIfGoingOnBatteries     = $false
$settings.StartWhenAvailable         = $true

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName $taskName -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Principal $principal -Settings $settings
Start-ScheduledTask   -TaskName $taskName

— Once the task is created, open Task Scheduler and confirm the `ForceSleep_Watcher` task is running

DISABLE THE DEFAULT SLEEPING SYSTEM:
Run this in PowerShell Administrator

powercfg -change -standby-timeout-ac 0
powercfg -change -standby-timeout-dc 0

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TEST THAT IT WORKS:

— Open a command prompt window and run `sleep`

— Confirm the watcher is enabled (`sleepstatus`) or turn it on (`sleepon`)

— Run `sleeptime` and set the idle time to 1 minute for testing

— Wait a full minute, don't touch your keyboard or mouse, once the sleep warning appears let it play out to confirm the PC sleeps

— When your done testing, use `sleeptime` again to set your idle time however you'd like
